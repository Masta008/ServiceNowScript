How can a developer resolve the following request from ServiceNow?
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

(function (finding, current) {

    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','client_callable_script_include');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}
	

})(finding, current);

To address the request from ServiceNow and ensure that all client callable script includes are secured with required roles, you can create an Access Control Rule (ACL) around the script include. Here's an example modification to the provided script that adds the necessary ACL rules:

javascript
Copy code
// ServiceNow Field "Script"
(function (finding, current) {

    // Check if the script include is already protected by an ACL
    var aclQuery = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    aclQuery.addQuery('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
    aclQuery.addQuery('script', current.sys_id); // Assuming sys_id is the unique identifier for the script include
    aclQuery.query();

    if (!aclQuery.next()) {
        // If no ACL found for the script include, create a new ACL
        var acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
        acl.initialize();
        acl.setValue('name', 'ClientCallableScriptInclude_' + current.name);
        acl.setValue('description', 'ACL for Client Callable Script Include ' + current.name);
        acl.setValue('script', current.sys_id);
        acl.setValue('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
        // Add required roles to the ACL
        acl.setValue('operation', 'execute');
        acl.insert();

        // Log the finding if a new ACL is created
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }

})(finding, current);
In this modification:

It checks if an ACL already exists for the specified client callable script include.
If no ACL is found, it creates a new ACL and associates it with the script include.
The required roles for the ACL are set using the setValue('operation', 'execute'); line. You may customize this part based on your specific requirements.
This modification ensures that each client callable script include is protected by an ACL, and the necessary roles are defined for access control. It also logs a finding if a new ACL is created. Make sure to test this modification in a safe environment before applying it to a production instance.
