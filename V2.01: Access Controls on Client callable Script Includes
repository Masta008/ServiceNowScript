//Step one : Presented the result Script from ServiceNow after the run of Instance Scan

//User 
//Please program a JavaScript script solution for the following ServiceNow request:
//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

//Answer
To address the ServiceNow request for creating an Access Control List (ACL) for a Client Callable Script Include (CCSI), you can use JavaScript to create the ACL. Below is a JavaScript script that you can use in your ServiceNow instance to define the required roles for accessing a Client Callable Script Include. Please note that this script should be run in a ServiceNow environment with administrative privileges:

// Define the name of the Client Callable Script Include
var scriptIncludeName = 'YourClientCallableScriptIncludeName';

// Define the required roles for accessing the Client Callable Script Include
var requiredRoles = ['snc_internal']; // You can add more roles as needed

// Create an ACL record for the Client Callable Script Include
var acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
acl.initialize();
acl.setValue('name', 'ACL for ' + scriptIncludeName);
acl.setValue('operation', 'execute');
acl.setValue('script_include', scriptIncludeName);
acl.setValue('script', 'current');
acl.insert();

// Attach the required roles to the ACL record
for (var i = 0; i < requiredRoles.length; i++) {
    var role = requiredRoles[i];
    var aclRole = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl_role');
    aclRole.initialize();
    aclRole.setValue('acl', acl.sys_id);
    aclRole.setValue('role', role);
    aclRole.insert();
}

gs.print('ACL created and roles attached for ' + scriptIncludeName);
Please make sure to replace 'YourClientCallableScriptIncludeName' with the actual name of your Client Callable Script Include, and adjust the requiredRoles array to include the roles that should have access to it.

After running this script, an ACL will be created for your Client Callable Script Include, and the specified roles will be granted access to it. This helps secure your Client Callable Script Include by restricting access to authorized users only.
