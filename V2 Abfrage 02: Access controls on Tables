//Step one : Presented the result Script from ServiceNow after the run of Instance Scan

//User 
//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
//"Description"
Tables should be secured with access controls, data in the table should be limited access to only necessary audience.

//"Resolution Details"
Make sure that all tables should have ACL's. Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it.

//ServiceNow Field "Script"
(function (finding, current) {
	
    var g_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		g_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		g_acl.query();
		if(!g_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}

})(finding, current);


// Answer
The provided JavaScript script is related to a ServiceNow request where you need to ensure that tables are secured with access controls and that all tables have ACLs (Access Control Lists). The script checks if an ACL with a name containing the current table name exists in the 'sys_security_acl' table. If it doesn't exist, it increments the 'finding' variable, which presumably keeps track of findings related to ACLs. Here's a breakdown of the script:

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {
    // Create a new GlideRecord object for 'sys_security_acl' table.
    var g_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');

    // Add a query to check if an ACL with a name containing the current table name exists.
    g_acl.addQuery('name', 'CONTAINS', current.name);

    // Execute the query.
    g_acl.query();

    // If no matching ACL is found, increment the 'finding' count.
    if (!g_acl.next()) {
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }
})(finding, current);
This script essentially checks if an ACL for the current table exists. If it doesn't, it increments a 'finding' count, indicating that an ACL is missing. Make sure that the 'finding' variable is defined and used appropriately in your ServiceNow context. This script is a starting point to ensure ACLs are in place but doesn't implement the ACLs themselves. You will need to define the ACLs separately in your ServiceNow instance based on your security requirements.
