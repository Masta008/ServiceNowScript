//Step one : Presented the result Script from ServiceNow after the run of Instance Scan

//User 
//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
//"Description"
Tables should be secured with access controls, data in the table should be limited access to only necessary audience.

//"Resolution Details"
Make sure that all tables should have ACL's. Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it.

//Answer
To address the ServiceNow request you mentioned, you can create a JavaScript script that enforces Access Control Lists (ACLs) for tables in your ServiceNow instance. ACLs allow you to restrict access to data by defining rules that users must meet before they can interact with the data. Here's a script that can help you ensure that all tables have ACLs:

javascript
Copy code
(function () {
  // Specify the table names for which you want to create ACLs
  var tablesToSecure = [
    "table_name_1",
    "table_name_2",
    // Add more table names as needed
  ];

  // Define the ACL properties
  var aclProperties = {
    operation: "read", // You can customize this based on your requirements
    role: "admin", // The role that has access
    condition: "true", // You can customize the condition as needed
    script: "", // You can add scripts for additional control
  };

  // Loop through the specified tables and create ACLs
  tablesToSecure.forEach(function (tableName) {
    var acl = new GlideACL();
    acl.name = "Secure " + tableName + " Table"; // ACL name
    acl.description = "ACL to secure access to the " + tableName + " table."; // ACL description
    acl.active = true;
    acl.applies_to = tableName;
    acl.operation = aclProperties.operation;
    acl.condition = aclProperties.condition;
    acl.role = aclProperties.role;
    acl.script = aclProperties.script;

    // Save the ACL
    var aclID = acl.insert();
    gs.log("Created ACL for " + tableName + " with ID: " + aclID);
  });

  // Log completion
  gs.log("ACL creation script completed.");
})();
Make sure to replace "table_name_1", "table_name_2", and any other table names in the tablesToSecure array with the names of the tables you want to secure with ACLs. You can also customize the ACL properties (operation, role, condition, and script) as per your specific requirements.

After creating the script, you can execute it within the ServiceNow environment. It will loop through the specified tables and create ACLs for each of them, ensuring that data access is restricted according to your defined rules
