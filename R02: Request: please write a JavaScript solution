//Request: please write a JavaScript solution
//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

//Answer 
It looks like you're requesting a JavaScript solution to create an access control list (ACL) in ServiceNow for a client callable script include. Below is a JavaScript code snippet that you can use to create an ACL for a client callable script include in ServiceNow. This script will check if the ACL exists for the given script include and create one if it doesn't exist. It uses the GlideRecord API to interact with the ServiceNow ACL table.

(function (current) {
    var scriptIncludeName = current.name;

    // Check if an ACL for the client callable script include already exists
    var acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    acl.addQuery('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
    acl.addQuery('name', scriptIncludeName);
    acl.query();

    if (!acl.next()) {
        // If the ACL doesn't exist, create a new ACL
        acl.initialize();
        acl.type = 'client_callable_script_include';
        acl.name = scriptIncludeName;
        acl.description = 'ACL for ' + scriptIncludeName;
        // Define the required roles for this ACL. You can customize this as needed.
        acl.roles = 'your_required_role_here';
        acl.insert();
    }
})(current);
Please replace 'your_required_role_here' with the actual roles that should have access to this client callable script include. This code will create the ACL if it doesn't exist and associate it with the specified script include.

Make sure to test this code in a controlled environment before deploying it to your production instance. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create ACLs in your ServiceNow instance.
