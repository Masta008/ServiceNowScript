Please write a JavaScript solution for ServiceNow
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

The provided JavaScript code is intended to create an access control rule (ACL) for a client callable script include in ServiceNow. The ACL checks whether a given client callable script include is protected by required roles. If not, it increments a finding and associates it with the current record.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

It starts by defining an anonymous function with two parameters, finding and current, which are objects used within the ServiceNow system.

Inside the function, it creates a new GlideRecord object for the 'sys_security_acl' table.

It adds two conditions to the GlideRecord object:

It filters records with the 'type' field equal to 'client_callable_script_include'.
It checks if the 'name' field contains the name of the current script include.
It then executes the query and checks if there's no next record in the result set (i.e., if no matching ACL record is found).

If no matching ACL record is found, it sets the current record as the source of the finding and increments the finding.

This code is designed to enforce security by ensuring that client callable script includes have the necessary access control rules defined. If not, it logs a finding to alert administrators or developers.

If you have a specific question or need further assistance with this code, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help.
