//User 
//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

//ServiceNow Field "Script"
(function (finding, current) {
    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','client_callable_script_include');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}
})(finding, current);

It seems like you want to create an Access Control List (ACL) in ServiceNow to secure a client callable script include and restrict access to it based on the required roles. You provided a script that checks if an ACL exists for the given client callable script include and increments a finding if it doesn't. Below is a JavaScript solution that you can use to create this ACL in ServiceNow:

javascript
Copy code
(function () {
    var scriptIncludeName = 'YourScriptIncludeName'; // Replace with your script include name
    var aclName = 'ACL_Name_For_Script_Include'; // Replace with a meaningful ACL name
    var requiredRoles = 'snc_internal'; // Replace with the required roles

    // Create or update the ACL for the script include
    var acl = new GlideAccessControlList();
    if (acl.get('name', aclName) && acl.get('operation', 'client_script')) {
        // ACL already exists, update it
        acl.setValue('description', 'ACL for ' + scriptIncludeName);
        acl.setValue('roles', requiredRoles);
        acl.update();
    } else {
        // ACL doesn't exist, create it
        acl.initialize();
        acl.setValue('name', aclName);
        acl.setValue('description', 'ACL for ' + scriptIncludeName);
        acl.setValue('script', scriptIncludeName);
        acl.setValue('operation', 'client_script');
        acl.setValue('roles', requiredRoles);
        acl.insert();
    }
})();
Here's how to use this script:

Replace 'YourScriptIncludeName' with the name of your client callable script include.
Replace 'ACL_Name_For_Script_Include' with a meaningful name for the ACL.
Replace 'snc_internal' with the required roles for access.
This script checks if the specified ACL for the given client callable script include already exists. If it exists, it updates the existing ACL; if not, it creates a new ACL. This ACL will restrict access to the script include based on the specified required roles.
