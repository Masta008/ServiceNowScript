How can a developer resolve the following request from ServiceNow? 
Reports shared with a role which does not exist might lead to unforeseen behaviour. Once a role with this name is created, immediately all the reports are shared with this role.

Reports shared with a role which does not exist might lead to unforeseen behaviour, once a role with this name is created and immediately all the reports are shared with this role. Consider removing the role by editing the report and only share the report with valid roles.

(function(finding, current) {

    var list = current.roles.split(',');
    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        var validator = new GlideRecord('sys_user_role');
        if (!validator.get('name', list[i])) {
            finding.increment();
        }
    }

})(finding, current);

The provided script appears to be a script include in ServiceNow, specifically designed to find and increment a counter (finding) if any of the roles associated with a report (current) do not exist in the sys_user_role table.

Here's an explanation of the script:

The script takes two parameters: finding and current. finding seems to be some kind of counter, and current is likely a reference to the current record being processed (possibly a report).

It splits the roles associated with the current record (current.roles) using a comma as a delimiter.

It then iterates through the list of roles and, for each role, creates a new GlideRecord (validator) for the sys_user_role table.

It attempts to get a record from the sys_user_role table where the name matches the current role. If it can't find such a record, it increments the finding counter.

The purpose of this script seems to be to identify roles associated with a report that do not exist in the sys_user_role table. If any such roles are found, the finding counter is incremented.

To address the request from ServiceNow, which suggests removing roles that do not exist, you can modify the script to remove invalid roles from the report. Here's a modified version of the script:

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {

    var list = current.roles.split(',');

    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        var validator = new GlideRecord('sys_user_role');
        if (!validator.get('name', list[i])) {
            finding.increment();

            // Remove the invalid role from the roles list
            list.splice(i, 1);
            i--; // Adjust the index to account for the removed element
        }
    }

    // Update the report with the valid roles
    current.roles = list.join(',');

})(finding, current);
This modification removes invalid roles from the current.roles list and updates the report with the remaining valid roles. Keep in mind that modifying records in a script has implications, and you should thoroughly test this in a non-production environment before deploying it. Additionally, ensure that the script runs in an appropriate context, such as a business rule or a client script, depending on your use case.
