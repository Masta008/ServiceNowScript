In ServiceNow, you can define roles at the page level in the Service Portal to restrict access to specific audiences. Here are the general steps to accomplish this:

Login to ServiceNow:

Access the ServiceNow instance where the Service Portal is hosted.
Log in with an account that has the necessary permissions to modify Service Portal settings.
Navigate to Service Portal Designer:

Go to the Service Portal application in ServiceNow.
Access the Service Portal:

In the Service Portal application, navigate to the "Service Portal" module or wherever the Service Portals are managed.
Edit the Service Portal:

Find and open the Service Portal you want to modify.
Navigate to the Pages Section:

Within the Service Portal, look for a section related to pages. It might be named "Pages," "Page Configurations," or something similar.
Edit the Page:

Locate the specific page for which you want to define roles.
Edit the page configuration.
Define Roles:

Look for an option related to access control, permissions, or roles within the page configuration settings.
Add the required roles to limit access to the desired audience.
Save your changes.
Test the Configuration:

After defining roles, it's important to test the configuration to ensure that access restrictions are working as intended.
Log in with different user accounts assigned to different roles to verify that only users with the appropriate roles can access the page.
Documentation:

Consider documenting the changes you made, especially if there are multiple developers or administrators working on the same instance.
Version Control (Optional):

If your ServiceNow instance supports version control for Service Portals, consider creating a version or backup of the Service Portal configuration before making significant changes.
Remember that the specific steps and options might vary slightly depending on the version of ServiceNow and the configuration of your instance. If you encounter any issues or if there are additional details in the ServiceNow request, refer to the ServiceNow documentation or seek assistance from your ServiceNow administrator.
