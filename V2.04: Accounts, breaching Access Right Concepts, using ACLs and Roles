How can a developer resolve the following request from ServiceNow?
Insider Threat.
Is there any account with Roles assigned and related ACLs configured to enable prohibited data manipulation like deleting records or changing. In order to protect against insiders with elevated or privileged access, access lists and roles should be monitored especially for deletion, the role assignment should be thoroughly reviewed to prevent unlogged/undocumented accounts with extra rights. This is valid throughout the whole platform and is not depending on any specific plugins or prerequirements.

All accounts having privileged access, including admin or security_admin, should be examined thoroughly to make sure that such an access level is required. If the access has been granted for a special purpose or for a specific task, the access should be revoked after the task is done or the time period is over. All the accounts having a role with Elevated privilege set to true, including security_admin and admin, should be verified and discussed. This definition will identify those accounts as findings.

Resolving a request related to insider threats in ServiceNow involves a combination of administrative tasks, security reviews, and documentation. Here is a step-by-step guide on how a developer can address this request:

Review Roles and ACLs:

Access the ServiceNow instance and navigate to the Roles and ACLs configuration.
Check all roles for permissions related to record deletion or data manipulation.
Identify any roles that grant elevated privileges and review their associated ACLs.
Monitor Access Lists and Roles:

Implement monitoring mechanisms for access lists and roles to detect any changes or unusual activities.
Regularly review access lists and roles to ensure they comply with the security policies.
Review Role Assignments:

Examine all user accounts to ensure they have only the roles necessary for their responsibilities.
Identify and investigate any accounts with unlogged or undocumented extra rights.
Admin and Security_Admin Accounts:

Thoroughly review all accounts with admin or security_admin roles.
Confirm that these high-privileged roles are necessary for the users and their responsibilities.
If not required, revoke unnecessary admin or security_admin access.
Task-based Privilege Reviews:

Regularly review accounts with elevated privileges granted for specific tasks.
Revoke access promptly once the task is completed or when the time period expires.
Elevated Privilege Role Verification:

Verify and discuss all accounts with roles having "Elevated privilege" set to true.
Evaluate whether this elevated privilege is necessary for the associated tasks or responsibilities.
Documentation:

Keep detailed documentation of role assignments, ACL configurations, and the rationale behind elevated privileges.
Maintain an up-to-date record of tasks requiring elevated privileges and their duration.
Periodic Audits:

Conduct periodic audits to ensure ongoing compliance with security policies.
Use ServiceNow reporting capabilities to generate audit reports on role assignments and access changes.
Training and Awareness:

Provide training to users and administrators on security best practices.
Raise awareness about the importance of timely revocation of unnecessary privileges.
Automation and Alerts:

Implement automated alerts for any unusual or unauthorized changes in roles and access lists.
Use ServiceNow's event management features to trigger alerts for potential insider threats.
By following these steps, a developer can contribute to a comprehensive approach to mitigating insider threats in a ServiceNow instance, ensuring that access is granted based on business needs and promptly revoked when no longer required. Regular reviews, documentation, and training are crucial elements in maintaining a secure and compliant environment.
