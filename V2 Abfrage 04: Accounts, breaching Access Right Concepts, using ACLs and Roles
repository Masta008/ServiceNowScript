//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
/ServiceNow Field: "Description"
Insider Threat.
Is there any account with Roles assigned and related ACLs configured to enable prohibited data manipulation like deleting records or changing. In order to protect against insiders with elevated or privileged access, access lists and roles should be monitored especially for deletion, the role assignment should be thoroughly reviewed to prevent unlogged/undocumented accounts with extra rights. This is valid throughout the whole platform and is not depending on any specific plugins or prerequirements.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
All accounts having privileged access, including admin or security_admin, should be examined thoroughly to make sure that such an access level is required. If the access has been granted for a special purpose or for a specific task, the access should be revoked after the task is done or the time period is over. All the accounts having a role with Elevated privilege set to true, including security_admin and admin, should be verified and discussed. This definition will identify those accounts as findings. 

//Answer
To create a JavaScript script to address the ServiceNow request you provided, you can use a server-side script in ServiceNow. Below is a sample script that you can adapt and use as an "OnSubmit" business rule, which runs when a record is submitted. This script checks the "Description" field for specific keywords and populates the "Resolution Details" field based on the content of the "Description" field.

javascript
Copy code
(function executeRule(current, previous /*, display_error*/ ) {
  var description = current.description.getDisplayValue();
  var resolutionDetails = "";

  // Check if the Description contains keywords related to insider threats
  if (description.match(/insider threat|prohibited data manipulation|privileged access|elevated privilege/i)) {
    resolutionDetails = "All accounts having privileged access, including admin or security_admin, should be examined thoroughly to make sure that such an access level is required. If the access has been granted for a special purpose or for a specific task, the access should be revoked after the task is done or the time period is over. All the accounts having a role with Elevated privilege set to true, including security_admin and admin, should be verified and discussed. This definition will identify those accounts as findings.";
  }

  // Set the Resolution Details field
  current.resolution_details = resolutionDetails;

})(current, previous);
Make sure to replace current.description and current.resolution_details with the actual field names in your ServiceNow instance if they are different. You can also adjust the regular expressions or keywords in the if condition to match the specific criteria you need.

This script will check the "Description" field for keywords related to insider threats and set the "Resolution Details" field accordingly. You can further customize the script to fit your specific requirements or trigger it in different ways, depending on your workflow.
