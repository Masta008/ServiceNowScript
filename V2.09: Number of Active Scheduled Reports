How can a developer resolve the following request from ServiceNow? 
Number of Active Scheduled Reports.  Scheduled reports export data which is no longer protected by ACLs and is no longer trackable.

Be aware of data leaving the instance.

Resolving the request for the number of active scheduled reports and addressing the concern about exported data that may no longer be protected by ACLs (Access Control Lists) and is not trackable involves a few steps. Here's a general guideline that a developer can follow in a ServiceNow environment:

Access Scheduled Reports:

Log in to the ServiceNow instance with administrative privileges.
Navigate to the Scheduled Reports module. This is typically found in the "Reports" or "Scheduled Reports" section.
Identify Active Scheduled Reports:

Review the list of scheduled reports to identify the active ones. This information is usually available in the Scheduled Reports module.
Review ACLs (Access Control Lists):

Examine the Access Control Lists (ACLs) associated with the tables and data involved in the scheduled reports.
Ensure that proper security measures are in place to protect sensitive data. Adjust ACLs if needed to restrict unauthorized access.
Data Protection Measures:

If scheduled reports export sensitive data, consider implementing additional data protection measures. For instance, you might want to encrypt the exported data or limit access to the exported files.
Implement Logging and Auditing:

Set up logging and auditing mechanisms to track activities related to scheduled reports. This can include logging when a report is scheduled, executed, and exported.
Ensure that logs capture relevant information, such as the user who initiated the export and the data included in the report.
Regularly Review and Monitor:

Establish a routine for reviewing and monitoring scheduled reports and associated data exports.
Regularly check logs and audit trails to identify any anomalies or potential security issues.
Educate Users:

Provide guidance and education to users who create and manage scheduled reports about the importance of data security.
Encourage users to review and understand the implications of their scheduled reports, especially in terms of data protection.
Automate Data Retention Policies:

Implement automated data retention policies to ensure that exported data is only retained for the necessary duration.
Regularly purge or archive outdated exported data to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
Consider Integration with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Tools:

Depending on the organization's security requirements, consider integrating ServiceNow with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools that can help prevent unauthorized data exports.
Testing:

Before making any changes, thoroughly test the impact on scheduled reports to ensure that necessary security measures are in place without disrupting critical business processes.
Documentation:

Document the security measures implemented and update any relevant documentation to reflect changes made to scheduled reports and data protection practices.
Remember that specific steps may vary based on the ServiceNow instance's version and customizations. Always follow best practices and consider consulting with your organization's ServiceNow administrator or security team for guidance tailored to your specific environment.
