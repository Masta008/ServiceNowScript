//User 
//Please program a JavaScript script solution for the following ServiceNow request:
/ServiceNow Field: "Description"
This is considered as exposure of sensitive information caused by mis-configured  service portal pages, pages should not be made public unless its necessary to support application requirements.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Please make sure that Public field is set to false in portal pages unless its necessary, make sure the access is limited to required audience.

//Answer
You can create a JavaScript script in ServiceNow that will address the ServiceNow request. This script can be run as a business rule or script include, depending on your specific requirements. Below is an example of how you can achieve this by updating the "Description" and "Resolution Details" fields when a record is updated.

(function executeRule(current, previous) {
  // Define the ServiceNow fields
  var descriptionField = current.description;
  var resolutionDetailsField = current.resolution_details;
  
  // Check if the Description field contains sensitive information
  var sensitiveInformationFound = checkForSensitiveInformation(descriptionField);
  
  // Check if the Public field is set to true in the portal page
  var isPublicPortalPage = isPublicPortalPage(current);
  
  // Set the Resolution Details field based on the checks
  if (sensitiveInformationFound) {
    current.resolution_details = "Sensitive information exposure due to misconfigured service portal page. Pages should not be made public unless necessary for application requirements.";
  } else if (isPublicPortalPage) {
    current.resolution_details = "Please make sure the Public field is set to false in portal pages unless necessary. Ensure access is limited to the required audience.";
  }
})(current, previous);

// Function to check for sensitive information in the Description field
function checkForSensitiveInformation(description) {
  // You can implement your own logic to check for sensitive information in the description field.
  // This example simply checks for the word "sensitive" in the description.
  return description.toLowerCase().includes("sensitive");
}

// Function to check if the Public field is set to true in the portal page
function isPublicPortalPage(current) {
  // You can implement your own logic to check the value of the Public field in the portal page.
  // This example assumes a boolean field named "public" in the current record.
  return current.public === true;
}
In this script:

We define the ServiceNow fields "descriptionField" and "resolutionDetailsField".
We check the "Description" field for the presence of sensitive information using the checkForSensitiveInformation function (you should customize this function according to your criteria).
We check if the "Public" field is set to true for the portal page using the isPublicPortalPage function (you should customize this function to match your field name and criteria).
Based on the checks, we update the "Resolution Details" field with the appropriate message.
Please make sure to customize this script to match your ServiceNow configuration, field names, and any specific criteria for detecting sensitive information and portal page settings.
