How can a developer resolve the following request from ServiceNow? 
Checks to see if the UI Action can be accessed by a user with no roles who does not have read access to the table.

Use conditions or visibility criteria to restrict access to UI Actions.

(function(finding, current) {

    var found = true;
    var gr = new GlideRecord("sys_ui_action_view");
    gr.addQuery('sys_ui_action', current.sys_id);
    gr.query();
    if (gr.next()) {
        found = false;
    }
    if (JSUtil.notNil(current.condition)) {
        if (current.condition.includes("gs.hasRole")) {
            found = false;
        }
    }

    var gr2 = new GlideRecord('sys_ui_action_role');
    gr2.addQuery('sys_ui_action', current.sys_id);
    gr2.query();
    if (gr2.next()) {
        found = false;
    }
    if (found) {
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }

})(finding, current);

It looks like the provided script is intended to check whether a UI Action can be accessed by a user with no roles and no read access to the table. The script is checking the presence of conditions and roles related to the UI Action.

Here's a breakdown of the script:

It initializes a variable found to true.
It queries the "sys_ui_action_view" table to check if there are any records related to the current UI Action (current.sys_id). If a record is found, it sets found to false.
It checks if the UI Action has a condition, and if that condition includes "gs.hasRole," it sets found to false.
It queries the "sys_ui_action_role" table to check if there are any records related to the current UI Action. If a record is found, it sets found to false.
If found is still true after these checks, it increments a finding and sets the current source.
Now, to address the request from ServiceNow to check if the UI Action can be accessed by a user with no roles who does not have read access to the table, you might want to consider the following:

Check Read Access:
Add a check to see if the user has read access to the table associated with the UI Action. You can use the GlideRecord.canRead() method for this.

Check User Roles:
Instead of just checking for the existence of roles, you may want to check specifically for the absence of roles for users with no roles. You can use GlideRecord to query the "sys_user_role" table and check if the user has any roles.

Review Conditions:
Consider reviewing the conditions part. If you want to allow access to users with no roles and no read access, make sure the conditions do not unintentionally restrict such users.

Here's an updated version of the script with these considerations:

javascript
Copy code
(function(finding, current) {

    var found = true;

    // Check if there are any records related to the current UI Action in sys_ui_action_view
    var gr = new GlideRecord("sys_ui_action_view");
    gr.addQuery('sys_ui_action', current.sys_id);
    gr.query();
    if (gr.next()) {
        found = false;
    }

    // Check if the UI Action has a condition that includes "gs.hasRole"
    if (JSUtil.notNil(current.condition) && current.condition.includes("gs.hasRole")) {
        found = false;
    }

    // Check if there are any records related to the current UI Action in sys_ui_action_role
    var gr2 = new GlideRecord('sys_ui_action_role');
    gr2.addQuery('sys_ui_action', current.sys_id);
    gr2.query();
    if (gr2.next()) {
        found = false;
    }

    // Check if the user has read access to the table associated with the UI Action
    var table = current.sys_table;
    if (!gs.hasRole("admin") && !gs.getSession().canRead(table)) {
        found = false;
    }

    // Check if the user has any roles
    var userRoles = new GlideRecord('sys_user_role');
    userRoles.addQuery('user', gs.getUserID());
    userRoles.query();
    if (userRoles.next()) {
        found = false;
    }

    // If 'found' is still true after these checks, increment finding and set the current source
    if (found) {
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }

})(finding, current);
This script now includes additional checks for read access to the table and the absence of roles for the user. Please adapt it further based on your specific requirements and the structure of your ServiceNow instance.
