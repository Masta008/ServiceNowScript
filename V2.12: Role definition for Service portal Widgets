To address the request from ServiceNow to define roles on service portal widgets to restrict access to a specific audience, you can follow these steps:

Access the ServiceNow Instance:
Log in to your ServiceNow instance using your developer credentials.

Navigate to the Service Portal:
Go to the Service Portal section in ServiceNow. This can usually be found in the application navigator.

Locate the Widget:
Identify the widget for which you need to define roles. Navigate to the Service Portal Designer or wherever the widgets are managed.

Edit the Widget:
Open the widget for editing. This might involve clicking on the widget's name or using an edit button depending on your ServiceNow version.

Configure Roles:
Look for a section or field related to roles within the widget configuration. This is where you specify the roles that have access to the widget.

Define Roles:
Specify the specific roles that should have access to the widget. This might involve selecting roles from a list or manually entering role names. Ensure that only the roles corresponding to the required audience are added.

Save Changes:
After configuring the roles, save the changes to the widget.

Test Access:
Test the widget to ensure that only users with the specified roles can access it. You may need to log in with different user accounts that have different roles to verify the access restrictions.

Documentation:
Update documentation to reflect the changes made to the widget, including the roles that have been defined for access.

Repeat for Other Widgets:
If there are multiple widgets that need role-based access, repeat the process for each widget.

Version Control:

Remember that the specific steps might vary slightly depending on the version of ServiceNow you're using. Always refer to the official ServiceNow documentation for the version you have to ensure accurate guidance.
