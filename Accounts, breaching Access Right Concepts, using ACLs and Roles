/ServiceNow Field: "Description"
Insider Threat.
Is there any account with Roles assigned and related ACLs configured to enable prohibited data manipulation like deleting records or changing. In order to protect against insiders with elevated or privileged access, access lists and roles should be monitored especially for deletion, the role assignment should be thoroughly reviewed to prevent unlogged/undocumented accounts with extra rights. This is valid throughout the whole platform and is not depending on any specific plugins or prerequirements.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
All accounts having privileged access, including admin or security_admin, should be examined thoroughly to make sure that such an access level is required. If the access has been granted for a special purpose or for a specific task, the access should be revoked after the task is done or the time period is over. All the accounts having a role with Elevated privilege set to true, including security_admin and admin, should be verified and discussed. This definition will identify those accounts as findings.

It seems like you're describing a comprehensive approach to mitigating insider threats within an organization's IT environment. Insider threats can be particularly challenging to manage because they involve individuals who have legitimate access to systems and data. Your approach includes several key components:

    Role and ACL Monitoring: Monitoring accounts with roles assigned and related access control lists (ACLs) to prevent prohibited data manipulation is a crucial step. This means keeping a close watch on who has access to what data and what actions they can perform with that access.

    Regular Review of Role Assignments: Regularly reviewing role assignments is essential to ensure that no unauthorized or undocumented accounts have extra rights. This helps in preventing employees from accumulating unnecessary privileges over time.

    Access Level Necessity: Examining all accounts with privileged access, including admin or security_admin, to determine whether their access level is necessary for their job responsibilities. If not, the access should be revoked to limit potential misuse.

    Time-Limited Access: Granting privileged access only for the duration of a specific task or a defined time period. Once the task is completed or the time period expires, the access should be revoked. This helps in reducing the potential for ongoing insider threats.

    Elevated Privilege Review: Accounts with roles that have Elevated privilege set to true, such as security_admin and admin, should be thoroughly reviewed and discussed. This ensures that individuals with these high-level privileges are properly authorized and monitored.

    Documentation: Maintain clear documentation of all access rights and role assignments. This documentation should be regularly audited and updated as necessary.

    Continuous Monitoring: Implement continuous monitoring of accounts, roles, and access controls to quickly detect any suspicious activity or unauthorized changes.

    Incident Response Plan: Develop a robust incident response plan to address any detected insider threats promptly. This plan should outline the steps to investigate, mitigate, and report any security incidents.

    Security Awareness Training: Provide ongoing security awareness training to all employees to educate them about the risks of insider threats and the importance of following security policies and procedures.

    Technical Controls: Implement technical controls like auditing, logging, and access controls within your IT systems to enhance your ability to detect and respond to insider threats.

Remember that insider threat mitigation is an ongoing process that requires a combination of technology, policies, and employee awareness. Regularly reviewing and refining your approach is essential to staying ahead of potential risks.

Creating a comprehensive solution script for insider threat detection and mitigation is a complex task that requires detailed knowledge of your organization's specific IT environment, tools, and processes. However, I can provide you with a simplified example script in Python that demonstrates how you might automate some aspects of insider threat monitoring and response. Please note that this script is a basic starting point and would require customization to fit your organization's needs.

python

import datetime
import logging

# Define a list of privileged roles
privileged_roles = ["admin", "security_admin"]

# Simulate a function to check if an account's access should be revoked
def check_account_access(account):
    # Replace this with your logic to determine if access should be revoked
    return account["access_expiration_date"] < datetime.date.today()

# Simulate a function to monitor role assignments and ACLs
def monitor_role_assignments():
    # Replace this with your logic to fetch role assignments and ACL configurations
    role_assignments = [{"user": "user1", "role": "admin"},
                        {"user": "user2", "role": "security_admin"}]
    
    for assignment in role_assignments:
        user = assignment["user"]
        role = assignment["role"]
        if role in privileged_roles:
            if check_account_access(user):
                logging.warning(f"Revoking access for {user} due to access expiration.")
                # Replace this with your logic to revoke access

# Simulate a function to continuously monitor for suspicious activity
def continuous_monitoring():
    while True:
        # Replace this with your logic to monitor for suspicious activity
        # You may want to use logs, audit trails, or anomaly detection tools
        # If suspicious activity is detected, trigger an alert and investigation

if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    
    # Periodically monitor role assignments and ACLs
    monitor_role_assignments()
    
    # Continuously monitor for suspicious activity
    continuous_monitoring()

Please note that this script is a simplified example and lacks the complexity of a real-world insider threat detection and mitigation solution. In practice, you would need to integrate it with your organization's security tools, access control systems, and data sources, as well as implement a more sophisticated monitoring and alerting mechanism.

Additionally, consider working with a security expert or consultant to design and implement a robust insider threat detection and mitigation solution tailored to your specific needs and infrastructure.
