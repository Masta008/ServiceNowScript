//Step one : Presented the result Script from ServiceNow after the run of Instance Scan

//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
ServiceNow administrators need to enable Report View ACLs to ensure data remains secure. Report View ACLs provide control around who can view reports protected by the Report View ACL. If Report View ACLs are left disabled, users may have access to report data that they should not.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
ServiceNow has provided the ACL Assessment for Reports application to scan your instance and product an inventory of reports and users that will be affected when the Report View ACLs are enabled. 
Install the ACL Assessment for Reports application from the ServiceNow store. Security Admin Role is required. 

//ServiceNow Field "Script"
(function (finding) {

    if(!GlidePluginManager.isActive("sn_report_acl")){
		finding.increment();
	}

})(finding);

//Answer ChatGPT
The provided script appears to be a ServiceNow script, specifically a script that is used to check if the "sn_report_acl" plugin is active in your ServiceNow instance. The purpose of this script is to determine whether the "ACL Assessment for Reports" application, which is dependent on the "sn_report_acl" plugin, is installed and active in your instance.

Here's how the script works:

    It checks whether the "sn_report_acl" plugin is active in your instance.
    If the "sn_report_acl" plugin is not active, it increments a counter (presumably for tracking or reporting purposes). This suggests that the script is intended to be used as part of an assessment or audit process to ensure that the required plugin is active before enabling Report View ACLs.

To use this script:

    Log in to your ServiceNow instance with a role that has sufficient permissions, such as the Security Admin Role.
    Access the script execution environment (e.g., Script Debugger or background script execution).
    Paste the provided script into the script editor.
    Execute the script to check the status of the "sn_report_acl" plugin.

If the plugin is active, you should see no action taken (i.e., the counter won't be incremented). If the plugin is not active, the script will increment the counter, indicating that you need to activate the "sn_report_acl" plugin before using the ACL Assessment for Reports application.

After ensuring that the "sn_report_acl" plugin is active, you can proceed with the installation and use of the "ACL Assessment for Reports" application to assess and manage your report access control.

//Answer ChatGPT
To write a script that checks for the presence and activation status of the "sn_report_acl" plugin and, if necessary, activates it, you can use the following ServiceNow scripting approach:

javascript

(function () {
    // Check if the "sn_report_acl" plugin is active
    var pluginName = "sn_report_acl";
    var pluginGr = new GlideRecord('sys_plugin');
    pluginGr.addQuery('name', pluginName);
    pluginGr.query();

    if (pluginGr.next() && !pluginGr.getValue('active')) {
        // The plugin is found but not active, so activate it
        gs.info('Activating the ' + pluginName + ' plugin...');
        pluginGr.setValue('active', true);
        pluginGr.update();

        // Check if activation was successful
        if (pluginGr.getValue('active')) {
            gs.info('The ' + pluginName + ' plugin has been activated.');
        } else {
            gs.error('Failed to activate the ' + pluginName + ' plugin.');
        }
    } else if (!pluginGr.next()) {
        // The plugin is not found in the sys_plugin table
        gs.error('The ' + pluginName + ' plugin is not installed in your instance.');
    } else {
        // The plugin is already active
        gs.info('The ' + pluginName + ' plugin is already active.');
    }
})();

Here's what this script does:

    It checks if the "sn_report_acl" plugin is already active. If it's active, it logs a message indicating that it's already active.

    If the plugin is not active but is found in the sys_plugin table, it attempts to activate it. It logs a message indicating that it's activating the plugin and checks if the activation was successful.

    If the plugin is not found in the sys_plugin table, it logs an error message indicating that the plugin is not installed in your instance.

To use this script:

    Log in to your ServiceNow instance with an appropriate role (e.g., Security Admin Role).

    Access the script execution environment (e.g., Script Debugger or background script execution).

    Paste the provided script into the script editor.

    Execute the script.

The script will either activate the "sn_report_acl" plugin if it's not active or report its status based on the conditions described above. Please make sure to test this script in a non-production environment before using it in a production instance.
