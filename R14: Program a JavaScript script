Program a javascript script:
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

(function (finding, current) {

    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','client_callable_script_include');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}
	

})(finding, current);

Your provided script is a business rule in ServiceNow that seems to be checking for the existence of an ACL (Access Control List) associated with a client callable script include. The goal is to ensure that there is an ACL defined for client callable script includes, and if not, increment a finding.

To create an ACL around the script include with a type of "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles, you can use the following code:

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {

    // Define the name of the script include
    var scriptIncludeName = current.name;

    // Query the sys_security_acl table for the ACL
    var aclGr = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    aclGr.addQuery('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
    aclGr.addQuery('name', scriptIncludeName);
    aclGr.query();

    // Check if the ACL exists
    if (!aclGr.next()) {
        // ACL does not exist, create a new ACL
        var newAcl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
        newAcl.initialize();
        newAcl.type = 'client_callable_script_include';
        newAcl.name = scriptIncludeName;
        
        // Add the required roles to the ACL
        newAcl.setValue('operations', 'read,execute'); // Add more operations if needed
        newAcl.setValue('roles', 'snc_internal,role2,role3'); // Add the required roles

        // Insert the new ACL
        var aclSysId = newAcl.insert();

        // Log the finding
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
        finding.setValue('message', 'ACL created for client callable script include: ' + scriptIncludeName + ', ACL Sys ID: ' + aclSysId);
    }

})(finding, current);
Make sure to customize the roles and operations according to your requirements. The script checks if there is an ACL for the given client callable script include, and if not, it creates a new ACL with the specified roles and operations. It then logs a finding indicating that an ACL has been created. Adjust the script as needed for your specific use case.
