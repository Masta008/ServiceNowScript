What is the solution for the following ServiceNow request? 
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

(function (finding, current) {

    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','client_callable_script_include');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}
	

})(finding, current);

The provided script appears to be a GlideRecord script written in JavaScript for ServiceNow. It aims to create an ACL (Access Control List) to secure client callable script includes.

Here's a breakdown of the script:

It defines a function that takes two parameters: finding and current.
Inside the function, it creates a new GlideRecord (gr_acl) for the 'sys_security_acl' table.
It adds two conditions to the GlideRecord:
The ACL type should be 'client_callable_script_include'.
The ACL name should contain the name of the current script include (current.name).
It queries the GlideRecord to check if an ACL matching the specified conditions exists.
If no matching ACL is found, it increments a counter (finding.increment()) and sets the current source (finding.setCurrentSource(current)).
The purpose of this script is to check if an ACL for the current client callable script include exists. If it doesn't exist, it increments a counter to track the finding and sets the current source.

Now, if you are facing an issue or have a specific question about this script, please provide more details, and I'll do my best to assist you.
