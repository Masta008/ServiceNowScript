program a javascript solution: 
//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

It looks like you want to create a JavaScript solution for implementing access control for certain fields in ServiceNow using ACLs. Below is a JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates how you can achieve this:

// ServiceNow Field: "Description"
// Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it. All client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

// ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
// Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on the console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

// ServiceNow Field "Script"
(function (finding, current) {
    // Check if the user has the necessary roles to access the script include.
    var requiredRoles = ['snc_internal']; // Add more roles as needed.
    var userRoles = gs.getUser().getRoles();
    
    var canAccessScriptInclude = false;
    for (var i = 0; i < requiredRoles.length; i++) {
        if (userRoles.indexOf(requiredRoles[i]) !== -1) {
            canAccessScriptInclude = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    if (canAccessScriptInclude) {
        var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
        gr_acl.addQuery('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
        gr_acl.addQuery('name', 'CONTAINS', current.name);
        gr_acl.query();
        
        if (!gr_acl.next()) {
            finding.setCurrentSource(current);
            finding.increment();
        }
    } else {
        // User does not have the required roles to access the script include.
        gs.addErrorMessage("You do not have the required roles to access this script include.");
    }
})(finding, current);
In this code:

We define the requiredRoles array, which contains the roles that are required to access the script include. You can add more roles as needed.

We get the user's roles using gs.getUser().getRoles() and check if the user has any of the required roles to access the script include.

If the user has the necessary roles, we proceed to check the ACL and increment the finding as necessary.

If the user does not have the required roles, we display an error message using gs.addErrorMessage() to inform the user that they cannot access the script include.

Please adjust the requiredRoles array with the roles that are required to access the script include according to your specific requirements.
