Program a JavaScript solution:
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

(function (finding, current) {

    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','client_callable_script_include');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}
	

})(finding, current);

Certainly! It looks like you're trying to create an ACL (Access Control List) for a client callable script include in ServiceNow. Here's an example of how you might modify your script:

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {

    // Check if the script include already has an ACL
    var grACL = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    grACL.addQuery('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
    grACL.addQuery('script_include', current.sys_id);
    grACL.query();

    if (!grACL.next()) {
        // If no ACL found, create a new one
        var newACL = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
        newACL.initialize();
        newACL.type = 'client_callable_script_include';
        newACL.script_include = current.sys_id; // Link to the script include
        newACL.operation = 'execute'; // Set the operation you want to control (e.g., execute)
        newACL.name = 'Access to ' + current.name; // Adjust the name as needed
        newACL.description = 'Controls access to ' + current.name; // Adjust the description as needed
        newACL.insert();

        // Optionally, you can define required roles for the ACL
        var roleNames = ['snc_internal']; // Add other roles as needed
        for (var i = 0; i < roleNames.length; i++) {
            var roleName = roleNames[i];
            var role = new GlideRecord('sys_user_role');
            role.addQuery('name', roleName);
            role.query();

            if (role.next()) {
                var aclRole = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl_role');
                aclRole.initialize();
                aclRole.acl = newACL.sys_id;
                aclRole.role = role.sys_id;
                aclRole.insert();
            } else {
                gs.error('Role not found: ' + roleName);
            }
        }

        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }

})(finding, current);
This script checks if an ACL already exists for the given client callable script include. If not, it creates a new ACL and associates it with the script include. Additionally, it assigns the required roles (e.g., 'snc_internal') to the ACL. Adjust the script as needed for your specific requirements.
