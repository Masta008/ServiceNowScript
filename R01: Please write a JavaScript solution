Please write a JavaScript solution: 
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

(function (finding, current) {

    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','client_callable_script_include');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}
	

})(finding, current);

To create an ACL (Access Control List) around a client callable script include in ServiceNow with the specified requirements, you can follow these steps:

Open the Script Include you want to protect.

Add the following code at the beginning of your Script Include:

javascript
Copy code
// Check if the current user has the required roles to access the script include
if (!gs.hasRole('snc_internal')) {
    // Additional role checks can be added here if needed
    gs.log('Access denied. User does not have the required roles.');
    // You can throw an exception or handle the access denial in a way that suits your application
    return;
}
This code checks if the current user has the 'snc_internal' role. If not, access is denied.

Now, you can update your ACL script to include this role-based access check. Here's an example:
javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {

    // Check if the current user has the required roles to access the script include
    if (!gs.hasRole('snc_internal')) {
        // Additional role checks can be added here if needed
        gs.log('Access denied. User does not have the required roles.');
        // Set the finding information accordingly
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
        return;
    }

    // Continue with your existing ACL logic

    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    gr_acl.addQuery('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
    gr_acl.addQuery('name', 'CONTAINS', current.name);
    gr_acl.query();

    if (!gr_acl.next()) {
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }

})(finding, current);
This code ensures that only users with the 'snc_internal' role can access the script include. If a user without the role tries to access it, the ACL will deny access and increment the finding accordingly. You can customize this further based on your specific requirements.
