How can a developer resolve the following request from ServiceNow? 
Scripted Web Services insert/update/delete data directly

Any update, insert or delete operations should be done in script include

ChatGPT
When ServiceNow requests that scripted web services be used for insert/update/delete operations, it means they want you to handle these operations within a script include rather than directly manipulating data in your scripts. Script includes in ServiceNow are reusable pieces of JavaScript code that can contain functions, variables, and other elements. They are commonly used to encapsulate business logic and data manipulation.

Here's a general guide on how you can resolve this request:

Create a Script Include:

Go to ServiceNow's application navigator.
Under "System Definition," find "Script Includes."
Create a new Script Include.
Write functions within this Script Include to handle insert, update, and delete operations.
Write Functions for CRUD Operations:

In your Script Include, write functions for the required CRUD operations. For example, you might have functions like createRecord, updateRecord, and deleteRecord.
Use ServiceNow's GlideRecord API within these functions to interact with records in the ServiceNow database.
javascript
Copy code
var MyScriptInclude = Class.create();

MyScriptInclude.prototype = {
   initialize: function() {},

   createRecord: function(tableName, data) {
      var gr = new GlideRecord(tableName);
      gr.initialize();
      // Set fields in the record using data
      gr.setValue('field1', data.field1);
      gr.setValue('field2', data.field2);
      // ...
      gr.insert();
   },

   updateRecord: function(tableName, sysID, data) {
      var gr = new GlideRecord(tableName);
      if (gr.get(sysID)) {
         // Update fields in the record using data
         gr.setValue('field1', data.field1);
         gr.setValue('field2', data.field2);
         // ...
         gr.update();
      }
   },

   deleteRecord: function(tableName, sysID) {
      var gr = new GlideRecord(tableName);
      if (gr.get(sysID)) {
         gr.deleteRecord();
      }
   },

   type: 'MyScriptInclude'
};
Call Script Include Functions from Scripted Web Service:

In your scripted web service script, instantiate the Script Include and call the functions you created.
javascript
Copy code
var myScriptInclude = new MyScriptInclude();
myScriptInclude.createRecord('incident', {field1: 'value1', field2: 'value2'});
myScriptInclude.updateRecord('incident', 'sys_id_here', {field1: 'new_value1'});
myScriptInclude.deleteRecord('incident', 'sys_id_here');
Configure Scripted Web Service:

Ensure that your scripted web service is properly configured to handle the incoming requests. You might need to define inputs, outputs, and other parameters depending on your requirements.
By following these steps, you'll be encapsulating the data manipulation logic within a script include, promoting reusability and maintainability in your ServiceNow instance. Additionally, using GlideRecord for database interactions helps ensure proper handling of ServiceNow's underlying database structure.
