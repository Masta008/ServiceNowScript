How can a developer resolve the following request from ServiceNow? 
Verify all the senders must have required role to trigger inbound action.

All inbound actions should have roles mentioned in "Required roles" field to secure actions triggered from inbound actions, only users with the required roles should be allowed to trigger inbound action

ChatGPT
To ensure that only users with the required roles can trigger inbound actions in ServiceNow, developers can follow these steps:

Access ServiceNow Instance:
Log in to your ServiceNow instance with administrative privileges.

Navigate to Inbound Actions:

Go to the application menu.
Open the "System Web Services" application.
Under "Inbound", select "Inbound Actions."
Review Existing Inbound Actions:

Review the existing inbound actions to identify the ones that need role verification.
Update Required Roles Field:

For each relevant inbound action, check and update the "Required roles" field.
Ensure that only the roles necessary for triggering the inbound action are specified.
Script Include (Optional):

If the "Required roles" field is not sufficient for your needs, you may need to use a script include.
Create a script include that contains a function to check if the current user has the necessary roles.
Call this function at the beginning of the inbound action script to enforce role verification.
Modify Inbound Action Script:

Open the script associated with the inbound action.
Add logic at the beginning of the script to verify if the current user has the required roles.
If the user doesn't have the required roles, prevent the action from continuing (e.g., throw an exception or log an error).
Test the Inbound Action:

Test the modified inbound action to ensure that only users with the specified roles can trigger it.
Documentation:

Document the role requirements for each inbound action in a central location.
Update documentation to reflect the changes made to the "Required roles" field or any additional role verification logic.
Regular Audits:

Periodically review and audit the inbound actions and their associated roles to ensure ongoing security.
Monitor and Log:

Implement logging to monitor who triggers inbound actions and whether they have the required roles.
Set up alerts for any unauthorized attempts to trigger inbound actions.
By following these steps, developers can ensure that only users with the specified roles can trigger inbound actions in ServiceNow, thus enhancing security and access control.
