What is the best practice for the following Servicenow request?
When there is no ACL for an UI Page, by default the UI Page can be accessed by all the logged-in internal users. If there is no, script level authorization checks like gs.hasRole('user_admin'), then any logged in user can access this UI Page and change anybody's password by passing the user sys_id and the new password.

UI Pages making call to server side code should have ACL's implemented.

(function (finding, current) {
	
    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','ui_page');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}

})(finding, current);

It looks like you're trying to enforce best practices for securing UI Pages in ServiceNow, and you've provided a script that checks if there is an ACL (Access Control List) implemented for a UI Page. It's a good practice to ensure that proper security measures are in place to control access to sensitive functionalities, such as changing passwords.

Here are some additional best practices and considerations:

Explicit ACLs: Instead of just checking if there is any ACL, consider checking for specific ACL rules that restrict access to the UI Page. This ensures that only authorized users or roles have access.

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {
    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    gr_acl.addQuery('type', 'ui_page');
    gr_acl.addQuery('name', 'CONTAINS', current.name);
    gr_acl.addQuery('operation', 'READ'); // Adjust the operation based on your needs
    gr_acl.query();

    if (!gr_acl.next()) {
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }
})(finding, current);
Role Checks: In addition to ACL checks, consider performing explicit role checks within your server-side code. This ensures that even if the ACL is not properly configured, the script won't execute for users without the required roles.

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {
    if (!gs.hasRole('user_admin')) {
        // Log or handle unauthorized access
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }
})(finding, current);
Logging: Implement logging to keep track of any attempts to access the UI Page without proper authorization. This can help in identifying security issues and responding to them promptly.

Code Review: Regularly review the scripts and ACLs to ensure they are up-to-date and in line with the security requirements. Code reviews can catch potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.

Automated Testing: Implement automated tests that include security checks to ensure that security-related functionalities are working as expected.

Documentation: Document the security measures in place for each UI Page, including ACLs and role requirements. This documentation can be helpful for future maintenance and audits.

Always consider the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users and scripts have only the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks. Regularly update and review security measures to adapt to changing requirements and potential security threats.
