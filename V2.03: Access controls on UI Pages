How can a developer resolve the following request from ServiceNow? When there is no ACL for an UI Page, by default the UI Page can be accessed by all the logged-in internal users. If there is no, script level authorization checks like gs.hasRole('user_admin'), then any logged in user can access this UI Page and change anybody's password by passing the user sys_id and the new password.

UI Pages making call to server side code should have ACL's implemented.

(function (finding, current) {
	
    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','ui_page');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}

})(finding, current);

It appears that the request is asking the developer to address a security concern related to UI Pages in ServiceNow. The provided script seems to be a Business Rule script, possibly part of a security review process. The purpose of this script is to check if there is an ACL (Access Control List) defined for a UI Page and to create a finding if there isn't.

To address this issue and enhance security, you should ensure that proper ACLs are defined for UI Pages. ACLs in ServiceNow control access to records and fields, including UI Pages. Here's a general guideline on how you can address the request:

Review Existing ACLs:

Examine the existing ACLs in your ServiceNow instance, especially those related to UI Pages.
Make sure there are ACLs that appropriately restrict access to sensitive operations or pages.
Update or Create ACLs:

If necessary, update existing ACLs to cover the required UI Pages.
Create new ACLs for UI Pages that currently lack access controls.
Adjust Script:

Modify the provided script to better handle the situation. Instead of simply checking for the existence of any ACL, it should specifically check for the presence of the required ACLs for the UI Pages.

Copy code
(function (finding, current) {
    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    gr_acl.addQuery('type', 'ui_page');
    gr_acl.addQuery('name', 'CONTAINS', current.name);
    gr_acl.addQuery('operation', 'READ'); // Adjust this to the appropriate operation (e.g., READ, WRITE)
    gr_acl.query();

    if (!gr_acl.next()) {
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }
})(finding, current);
This modification ensures that the script checks for ACLs specific to UI Pages and the desired operation.

Testing:

After making changes, thoroughly test the UI Pages to ensure that the ACLs are working as expected.
Verify that only users with the appropriate roles can access and perform actions on the UI Pages.
Documentation:

Document the changes made, including any new or modified ACLs, for future reference and auditing.
Remember that security is an ongoing process, and regular reviews and updates are essential to maintain a secure ServiceNow instance.
