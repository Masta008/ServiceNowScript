Write a JavaScript solution:

Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

It seems like you want to create a JavaScript solution for a ServiceNow Access Control List (ACL) to restrict access to Client Callable Script Includes based on certain conditions. Here's a JavaScript code snippet for your use case:

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {
    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    gr_acl.addQuery('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
    gr_acl.addQuery('name', 'CONTAINS', current.name);
    gr_acl.query();
    
    if (!gr_acl.next()) {
        // This means the script include is not protected by an ACL.
        // You can define your ACL rules here, or you can set the required roles.
        
        // For example, you can check the user's role and allow access if they have a specific role.
        var userRoles = gs.getUser().getRoles();
        
        if (userRoles.contains('snc_internal')) {
            // Allow access for users with the 'snc_internal' role.
            // You can add more role checks here if needed.
            finding.setCurrentSource(current);
            finding.increment();
        }
    }
})(finding, current);
This script first checks if there is an existing ACL for the Client Callable Script Include with a name that contains the current name. If no ACL is found, it checks the user's roles and allows access if the user has the 'snc_internal' role.

Please note that you should adjust the ACL rules or role checks as per your specific requirements. This code provides a basic framework that you can expand upon to meet your exact access control needs in your ServiceNow instance.
