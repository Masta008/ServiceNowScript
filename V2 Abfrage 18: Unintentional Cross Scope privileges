//Step one : Presented the result Script from ServiceNow after the run of Instance Scan

++Communitation with ChatGPT++

//User 
//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
Having many Cross Privileges in a custom application, might be an indication that during development these Cross Scope privileges were added unintentionally.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Recommendation is to investigate each Cross Scope privilege and identify whether this is really needed as part of the application. If not remove the privilege.
Removing privileges might require regression testing to ensure that nothing will break. The extend of testing will depend on the Application size.

//ServiceNow Field "Script"
(function(finding, current) {

    var threshold = 25; // number of cross scope 
    // get number of cross scope privileges
    var snGr = new GlideAggregate('sys_scope_privilege');
    snGr.addQuery('sys_scope', current.sys_id.toString());
    snGr.addAggregate('COUNT');
    snGr.query(); // get all
    if (snGr.next()) {
        // compare against threshold
        var count = snGr.getAggregate('COUNT');
        if (count > threshold) {
            // add finding

            finding.setCurrentSource(current);
            finding.increment();
        }
    }


})(finding, current);
