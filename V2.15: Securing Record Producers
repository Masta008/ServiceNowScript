//Step one : Presented the result Script from ServiceNow after the run of Instance Scan

++Communitation with ChatGPT++

//User 
//Please program a JavaScript script solution for the following ServiceNow request:
//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
If appropriate roles are not assigned to record producers then, an unauthorized users can access it by directly navigating to the URL and thereby revealing unnecessary and sensitive information.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Record producers should be assigned appropriate role, record producer script should secure GlideRecord and/or GlideSystem API calls.

//Answer

To address the ServiceNow request, you can create a server-side script in ServiceNow that checks if the appropriate roles are assigned to record producers and secures GlideRecord and GlideSystem API calls. Here's a JavaScript script that you can use as a starting point:

(function executeRule(current, previous /* other possible inputs */) {
    // Check if the current record is a Record Producer
    if (current.getValue('producer') === true) {
        // Check if the user has the appropriate roles
        var requiredRoles = ['role1', 'role2', 'role3']; // Replace with the actual roles
        var userRoles = gs.getUser().getRoles();
        var hasRequiredRoles = false;

        for (var i = 0; i < requiredRoles.length; i++) {
            if (userRoles.indexOf(requiredRoles[i]) !== -1) {
                hasRequiredRoles = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (!hasRequiredRoles) {
            // If the user doesn't have the required roles, deny access
            gs.addErrorMessage('Unauthorized access. You do not have the required roles to access this record producer.');
            current.setAbortAction(true);
            return;
        }
    }

    // If the user has the appropriate roles, continue with the record producer script
    // Secure GlideRecord and GlideSystem API calls as needed in the script.

})(current, previous);
Make sure to replace 'role1', 'role2', and 'role3' with the actual roles that should have access to the record producer. This script should be placed in a business rule or other appropriate script execution location within ServiceNow to enforce the access control and secure API calls for record producers.
