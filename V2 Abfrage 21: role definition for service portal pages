//User 
//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
All service portal pages must have specific role defined at page level to restrict access to required audience.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Make sure to define roles on service portal page to limit access to required audience.

//Answer
To create a JavaScript script solution for your ServiceNow request, you can use the ServiceNow API to work with records in the "Description" and "Resolution Details" fields of the incident table. Below is a sample script that demonstrates how to accomplish this task:

javascript
Copy code
// Set the table name and record sys_id
var tableName = 'incident'; // Replace with the appropriate table name
var recordSysID = 'YOUR_INCIDENT_SYS_ID'; // Replace with the actual sys_id

// Define the role names for specific access
var descriptionRole = 'DescriptionAccessRole';
var resolutionDetailsRole = 'ResolutionDetailsAccessRole';

// Function to update the 'Description' field
function updateDescriptionField() {
    var gr = new GlideRecord(tableName);
    if (gr.get(recordSysID)) {
        gr.setValue('description', 'All service portal pages must have specific role defined at page level to restrict access to required audience.');
        gr.update();

        // Assign the role to the user or group that should have access
        assignRole(gr, descriptionRole);
    }
}

// Function to update the 'Resolution Details' field
function updateResolutionDetailsField() {
    var gr = new GlideRecord(tableName);
    if (gr.get(recordSysID)) {
        gr.setValue('resolution_details', 'Make sure to define roles on the service portal page to limit access to the required audience.');
        gr.update();

        // Assign the role to the user or group that should have access
        assignRole(gr, resolutionDetailsRole);
    }
}

// Function to assign a role to the user or group
function assignRole(gr, roleName) {
    var role = new GlideSysUser();
    role = role.getUserByName(roleName);
    
    if (role) {
        var grm = new GlideSysUserHasRole();
        grm.initialize(gr.sys_id, role.sys_id);
        grm.insert();
    } else {
        gs.error('Role not found: ' + roleName);
    }
}

// Call the functions to update fields and assign roles
updateDescriptionField();
updateResolutionDetailsField();

// Output a message
gs.print('Fields updated and roles assigned successfully.');
Before using this script, please make sure to replace 'YOUR_INCIDENT_SYS_ID' with the actual sys_id of the incident record you want to update. Additionally, adjust the table name and role names according to your specific ServiceNow instance.

This script will update the "Description" and "Resolution Details" fields of the specified incident record and assign the specified roles to ensure access control as per your request.
