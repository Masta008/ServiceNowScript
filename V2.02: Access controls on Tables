What is the best practice for the following Servicenow request?
Tables should be secured with access controls, data in the table should be limited access to only necessary audience.

Make sure that all tables should have ACL's. Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it.

(function (finding, current) {
	
    var g_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		g_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		g_acl.query();
		if(!g_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}

})(finding, current);

The script you've provided is a Business Rule script in ServiceNow, specifically for checking whether a particular table has an ACL (Access Control List) associated with it. ACLs in ServiceNow are used to control who can access records in a table and what operations (create, read, update, delete) they can perform.

The script checks if there is an ACL for the current table, and if not, it increments a finding. This is a good approach to enforce the presence of ACLs for tables, which is a best practice for securing data in ServiceNow.

However, it's important to note that having an ACL alone doesn't ensure that access controls are properly configured. You also need to define the rules within the ACL to specify which roles or users can perform specific operations on records in the table.

Here's an example of how you can modify your script to check not just for the presence of ACLs but also ensure that the ACL has proper rules:

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {
    // Check if there is an ACL for the current table
    var acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    acl.addQuery('name', 'CONTAINS', current.name);
    acl.query();

    if (!acl.next()) {
        // If no ACL is found, increment the finding
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    } else {
        // If ACL is found, check if it has proper rules
        var aclRules = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl_role');
        aclRules.addQuery('acl', acl.sys_id);
        aclRules.query();

        if (!aclRules.next()) {
            // If no rules found for the ACL, increment the finding
            finding.setCurrentSource(current);
            finding.increment();
        }
    }
})(finding, current);
This modification adds a check for the presence of rules in the ACL. If there are no rules defined for the ACL, it increments the finding. This ensures not only that an ACL exists but also that it has rules defining who can access the data and what operations they can perform.
