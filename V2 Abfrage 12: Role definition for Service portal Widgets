//User 
//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
All service portal widgets must have specific role defined at widget level to restrict access to required audience.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Make sure to define roles on service portal widget to limit access to required audience.

//Answer
To create a JavaScript script for your ServiceNow request, you can use ServiceNow's server-side scripting capabilities. In this case, it seems like you want to enforce a rule that all service portal widgets have specific roles defined at the widget level. You can do this with a business rule in ServiceNow. Here's a sample script that you can use as a starting point:

// Business Rule Script

(function executeRule(current, previous /*, display_error*/) {

    // ServiceNow Field: "Description"
    var description = current.description;

    // ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
    var resolutionDetails = current.resolution_details;

    // Check if the description contains the required text
    if (description.indexOf("All service portal widgets must have specific role defined at widget level") !== -1) {
        // Check if the resolution details contain the required text
        if (resolutionDetails.indexOf("Make sure to define roles on service portal widget to limit access to required audience.") !== -1) {
            // Check if this is related to a service portal widget (you can add your own condition here)
            if (current.category == "Service Portal Widgets") {
                // Check if roles are defined for the widget
                if (!current.u_roles_defined) {
                    // Add a comment to the record
                    current.comments = "Roles are not defined for this service portal widget. Please define roles to restrict access to the required audience.";
                    // You can also add additional actions, such as setting a flag, sending notifications, etc.
                }
            }
        }
    }

})(current, previous);
This script assumes that you have a table where you're recording these service portal widgets and their associated information. Make sure to adapt the script to your specific ServiceNow configuration, including the conditions for identifying service portal widgets and any custom fields you may have.

Remember that you should also define the appropriate business rules and triggers in ServiceNow to execute this script when records are created or updated. This script serves as a starting point and should be customized to fit your exact requirements and ServiceNow configuration.
