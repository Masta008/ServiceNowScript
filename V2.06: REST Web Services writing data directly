The request from ServiceNow is asking for data manipulation operations (insert, update, delete) to be handled through a Script Include when working with Scripted Web Services. Here's a general guide on how a developer can approach this task:

Understand Scripted Web Services:
Familiarize yourself with the ServiceNow documentation on Scripted Web Services, as provided in the link you shared.

Create a Script Include:
Create a new or use an existing Script Include in ServiceNow. This script include will contain the logic for handling data manipulation operations.

Implement Insert/Update/Delete Methods:
Within the Script Include, implement methods for insert, update, and delete operations. These methods should include the necessary logic to handle these operations on the relevant ServiceNow tables.

Handle Security and Permissions:
Ensure that your Script Include handles security and permissions appropriately. Depending on your use case, you may need to incorporate business rules or ACLs (Access Control Rules) to control who can perform these operations.

Integrate with Scripted Web Service:
Modify or create your Scripted Web Service to utilize the methods you implemented in the Script Include. The web service should call the appropriate methods based on the requested operation (insert, update, delete).

Testing:
Thoroughly test your implementation. Verify that data manipulation operations through the Scripted Web Service are working as expected and that security measures are in place.

Logging and Error Handling:
Implement logging and error handling mechanisms within your Script Include to capture and report any issues that may occur during data manipulation.

Documentation:
Document your implementation, especially if others will be working with or maintaining this code. Include information about the purpose of the Script Include, the methods available, and any considerations for security.

Deployment:
Deploy your changes to the appropriate ServiceNow instance(s). Make sure to follow your organization's deployment procedures.

Monitor and Maintain:
Keep an eye on the system after deployment, monitor logs, and address any issues that may arise. Also, stay informed about updates or changes in the ServiceNow platform that may impact your implementation.

Remember to adapt these steps to fit the specific requirements and conventions of your ServiceNow instance and the application you are working on.
