Write a short JavaScript solution: 
//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

The provided JavaScript code appears to be related to ServiceNow and is used to check if there is a GlideRecord object associated with a specific client callable script include in ServiceNow. It looks for the existence of an ACL for a script include and increments a "finding" if the ACL does not exist. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {
    // Create a GlideRecord object for the 'sys_security_acl' table.
    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    
    // Add queries to filter ACL records.
    gr_acl.addQuery('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
    gr_acl.addQuery('name', 'CONTAINS', current.name);
    
    // Execute the query.
    gr_acl.query();

    // If no ACL record is found, increment the 'finding' variable.
    if (!gr_acl.next()) {
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }
})(finding, current);
This code takes two parameters, "finding" and "current," which are expected to be objects from a ServiceNow context. It searches for a security ACL with the type "client_callable_script_include" that contains the name of the current script include. If no ACL record is found, it increments the "finding" variable.

It's important to note that this code should be executed in the context of a ServiceNow business rule, script include, or some other server-side script context within ServiceNow. The purpose of this code appears to be enforcing access control by checking if a specific client callable script include has an associated ACL, and if not, incrementing a "finding" counter.

Make sure to include this code in the appropriate context within your ServiceNow instance and ensure that it aligns with your access control and security policies.
