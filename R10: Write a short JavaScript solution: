Write a short JavaScript solution: 
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

(function (finding, current) {

    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','client_callable_script_include');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}
	

})(finding, current);

Your provided JavaScript code seems to be a part of a Business Rule or a Script Include that's designed to enforce Access Control Lists (ACLs) for client callable script includes. The script checks if there is a sys_security_acl record of type "client_callable_script_include" associated with the current script include, and if not, it increments a finding counter.

Here's a small modification to include the definition of required roles:

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {

    // Define the required roles for access control
    var requiredRoles = ['snc_internal'];

    // Check if the user has the required roles
    if (gs.hasRole(requiredRoles)) {
        // If the user has the required roles, check for ACL
        var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
        gr_acl.addQuery('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
        gr_acl.addQuery('name', 'CONTAINS', current.name);
        gr_acl.query();

        if (!gr_acl.next()) {
            // If no ACL is found, increment the finding counter
            finding.setCurrentSource(current);
            finding.increment();
        }
    }

})(finding, current);
In this modification, requiredRoles is an array that contains the roles required for access. The gs.hasRole(requiredRoles) checks if the current user has the necessary roles before proceeding to check the ACL.

Note: It's important to validate and adapt this code according to your specific use case and system requirements. Also, ensure that you have proper error handling and logging in your production code.
