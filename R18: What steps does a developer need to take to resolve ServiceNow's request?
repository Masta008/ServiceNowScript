What steps does a developer need to take to resolve ServiceNow's request? Tables should be secured with access controls, data in the table should be limited access to only necessary audience.

Make sure that all tables should have ACL's. Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it.

(function (finding, current) {
	
    var g_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		g_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		g_acl.query();
		if(!g_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}

})(finding, current);

It looks like you have provided a script that checks if there are access control lists (ACLs) for a table in ServiceNow and increments a finding if ACLs are missing. While this script is a good starting point for identifying missing ACLs, there are additional steps and considerations to ensure proper security in ServiceNow. Below are steps and explanations to guide a developer through the process:

Identify Tables:

Create a list of tables in your ServiceNow instance that need to be secured. This includes tables containing sensitive data or those that shouldn't be accessed by all users.
Review Existing ACLs:

Check the existing ACLs in the ServiceNow instance to see if there are any ACLs already defined for the identified tables. This can be done through the ServiceNow web interface or by querying the sys_security_acl table.
Create Missing ACLs:

For tables without ACLs, create new ACLs. ACLs define who can access the records in a table and what operations (create, read, update, delete) they can perform.
Define ACL Rules:

Specify the rules for each ACL to ensure that access is restricted appropriately. Rules can be based on user roles, conditions, or other criteria.
Test ACLs:

After creating or modifying ACLs, thoroughly test them to ensure they are working as intended. Test with different user roles to verify that access is appropriately restricted.
Consider Field Level Security:

For additional security, consider implementing field-level security. This allows you to control access to specific fields within a record.
Regularly Review and Update ACLs:

Security requirements may change over time. Regularly review and update ACLs to reflect any changes in the organization's security policies.
Document ACLs:

Document the ACLs you have defined, including the purpose of each ACL, the tables it applies to, and the access rules it enforces. This documentation is crucial for maintaining and auditing your security model.
Use Scripted ACLs if Needed:

For complex access control scenarios, you may need to use scripted ACLs. These are ACLs that execute a script to determine access rights dynamically.
Integrate with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Leverage ServiceNow's role-based access control system to assign roles to users and control their access based on these roles.
Review Security Best Practices:

Familiarize yourself with ServiceNow security best practices and recommendations to ensure that your implementation aligns with industry standards.
Here's an example of how you might modify your existing script to automatically create ACLs for tables without them:

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {
    var tableName = current.name.toString();

    // Check if ACL exists for the table
    if (!gs.hasRole('admin')) {
        var acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
        acl.addQuery('name', tableName);
        acl.query();

        // If no ACL found, create one
        if (!acl.next()) {
            var newACL = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
            newACL.initialize();
            newACL.setValue('name', tableName);
            newACL.setValue('operation', 'read'); // Adjust based on your requirements
            newACL.setValue('description', 'ACL for ' + tableName);
            newACL.setValue('active', true);
            newACL.setValue('script', ''); // Add script if needed
            newACL.insert();

            finding.setCurrentSource(current);
            finding.increment();
        }
    }
})(finding, current);
Please note that this is a basic example, and you may need to customize it further based on your specific requirements and security policies. Also, ensure that the script is running in a secure and controlled manner, as it deals with security-related operations.
