Write a short JavaScript solution: 
Rules for access control lists (ACLs) restrict access to data by requiring users to pass a set of requirements before they can interact with it, all client callable script includes should be secured with required roles.

Any logged-in users with minimum snc_internal can access an unprotected CCSI by default. Attacker can run a GlideAjax on console or do a custom HTTP request xmlhttp.do and can execute functions defined in Client callable script include. Create ACL around script include with Type as "client_callable_script_include" and define required roles.

(function (finding, current) {

    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','client_callable_script_include');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}
	

})(finding, current);

Your JavaScript code seems to be checking if a corresponding ACL (Access Control List) exists for a client callable script include, and if not, it increments a finding. However, it doesn't seem to set up the required roles for the ACL. Here's an updated version of your code that includes the necessary ACL setup:

javascript
Copy code
(function (finding, current) {

    // Function to create ACL entry for client callable script include
    function createACL(scriptIncludeName) {
        var acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
        acl.initialize();
        acl.setValue('name', scriptIncludeName);
        acl.setValue('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
        acl.insert();
    }

    // Check if an ACL entry exists for the current script include
    var acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
    acl.addQuery('type', 'client_callable_script_include');
    acl.addQuery('name', 'CONTAINS', current.name);
    acl.query();

    if (!acl.next()) {
        // If no ACL exists, create one
        createACL(current.name);

        // Optionally, you can set up required roles for the ACL here
        // For example, to require the role 'snc_internal':
        var aclRoles = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl_role');
        aclRoles.addQuery('acl', acl.sys_id);
        aclRoles.addQuery('name', 'snc_internal');
        aclRoles.query();
        if (!aclRoles.next()) {
            var role = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl_role');
            role.initialize();
            role.setValue('acl', acl.sys_id);
            role.setValue('name', 'snc_internal');
            role.insert();
        }

        // Increment finding
        finding.setCurrentSource(current);
        finding.increment();
    }

})(finding, current);
This code includes a function createACL to create an ACL entry for a client callable script include, and it checks if the entry already exists. If not, it creates the ACL entry and optionally sets up the required roles. Note that you may need to adjust the role-related logic based on your specific requirements and role structure.
