How can a developer resolve the following request from ServiceNow? 
Planned Start and End date of change records are very sensitive and should be protected.  UI Policies applied to the date fields on the form are not effecitve because users can still update it for example in list view.

It is recommended to use ACLs to secure those date fields rather than UI Policies.  If ACLs are already existing then there is no need to use the UI Policy.

To address the sensitivity of Planned Start and End date fields in ServiceNow and ensure that users cannot update them in list view, you can use Access Control Rules (ACLs). ACLs are a powerful way to control access to data and operations in ServiceNow.

Here are the general steps you can follow to implement ACLs for this scenario:

1. Identify the Fields:
Identify the Planned Start and End date fields in the Change form for which you want to restrict access.

2. Create an ACL:
Create an Access Control Rule (ACL) to control access to these date fields. ACLs can be found in the "Security Rules" section in the ServiceNow platform.

Navigate to "System Security" > "Access Control" > "Roles".
Create a new ACL record for the table containing the date fields (e.g., Change Request [change_request]).
3. Define the ACL Conditions:
Set the conditions for the ACL to restrict access to the fields.

In the ACL record, specify the operation (e.g., read, write) for which you want to control access.
Define conditions using script fields. For example, you might check the user's role or other criteria to determine whether they have the right to update these date fields.
4. Test the ACL:
Before applying the ACL to the production instance, test it in a development or test instance to ensure it behaves as expected.

5. Apply the ACL to the Field:
Once the ACL is tested and verified, apply it to the specific date fields in the Change Request table.

Navigate to "System Definition" > "Tables".
Open the Change Request [change_request] table.
Locate the Planned Start and End date fields.
Set the "Write ACL" field to the ACL you created.
6. Confirm Security:
Ensure that the ACL effectively restricts users from updating these fields in list views and other forms.

7. Documentation:
Document the ACL for future reference and for the benefit of other developers or administrators.

Important Note:
Make sure to thoroughly test any changes in a non-production environment before applying them to the production instance. Also, consider involving ServiceNow administrators or relevant stakeholders to ensure that the implemented ACLs align with security policies and user requirements.
