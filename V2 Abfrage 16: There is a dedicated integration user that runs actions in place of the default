//Step one : Presented the result Script from ServiceNow after the run of Instance Scan

//User 
//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
internal_integration_user field on user record can be checked, i.e. if any of the interation method is active and this field is not true for any record should be recorded as finding. However it may be tricky to check if  all the possible integrations are active?


//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Run as user in automated scripts should have internal_integration_user field checked in user record'

//Answer
To achieve this in ServiceNow, you can use a script that checks if any of the integration methods are active and the internal_integration_user field is not set to true for any user record. You can use a scheduled background script to periodically perform this check. Here's a JavaScript script for this purpose:

// Scheduled background script to check user records for active integrations

(function () {
    // Define the integration methods that need to be checked for activity
    var integrationMethodsToCheck = ['integrationMethod1', 'integrationMethod2', 'integrationMethod3'];

    // Create a GlideRecord query to fetch user records
    var userRecord = new GlideRecord('sys_user');
    userRecord.addQuery('active', true);
    userRecord.query();

    while (userRecord.next()) {
        var userActive = false; // Flag to track if any active integration is found

        // Check each integration method
        for (var i = 0; i < integrationMethodsToCheck.length; i++) {
            var integrationMethod = userRecord.getValue(integrationMethodsToCheck[i]);
            if (integrationMethod === true) {
                userActive = true;
                break; // No need to check further if an active integration is found
            }
        }

        // If no active integration is found and internal_integration_user is not true, record a finding
        if (!userActive && !userRecord.internal_integration_user) {
            gs.log('Finding: User ' + userRecord.user_name + ' has no active integration method.');
            // You can log the finding or take other actions as needed
        }
    }
})();
Please replace 'integrationMethod1', 'integrationMethod2', and 'integrationMethod3' with the actual field names that represent the integration methods in your ServiceNow instance.

You can schedule this script to run at regular intervals using a scheduled job in ServiceNow. It will iterate through user records, check the specified integration methods, and log a finding if no active integration is found and internal_integration_user is not true for any user.

Make sure to test the script in a non-production environment first and adapt it to your specific ServiceNow instance's schema and needs.
