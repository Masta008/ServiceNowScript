How can a developer resolve the following request from ServiceNow? 
Having many Cross Privileges in a custom application, might be an indication that during development these Cross Scope privileges were added unintentionally.

Recommendation is to investigate each Cross Scope privilege and identify whether this is really needed as part of the application. If not remove the privilege.
Removing privileges might require regression testing to ensure that nothing will break. The extend of testing will depend on the Application size.

(function(finding, current) {

    var threshold = 25; // number of cross scope 
    // get number of cross scope privileges
    var snGr = new GlideAggregate('sys_scope_privilege');
    snGr.addQuery('sys_scope', current.sys_id.toString());
    snGr.addAggregate('COUNT');
    snGr.query(); // get all
    if (snGr.next()) {
        // compare against threshold
        var count = snGr.getAggregate('COUNT');
        if (count > threshold) {
            // add finding

            finding.setCurrentSource(current);
            finding.increment();
        }
    }


})(finding, current);

The provided script appears to be a ServiceNow script written in JavaScript. It seems to be checking the number of cross-scope privileges associated with a specific custom application and raising a finding if the count exceeds a predefined threshold.

To address the request to investigate and potentially remove unnecessary cross-scope privileges, you can follow these steps:

Review Cross-Scope Privileges:

Understand the purpose of each cross-scope privilege in your custom application.
Verify whether each privilege is necessary for the functionality of the application.
Modify the Script:

If you identify privileges that are unnecessary, you can remove them directly from the script.

javascript
Copy code
// Remove unnecessary cross-scope privileges
var snGr = new GlideRecord('sys_scope_privilege');
snGr.addQuery('sys_scope', current.sys_id.toString());
snGr.query();
while (snGr.next()) {
    // Check conditions and remove unnecessary privileges
    if (/* Your condition for unnecessary privilege */) {
        snGr.deleteRecord();
    }
}
Regression Testing:

As mentioned in the request, removing privileges might impact the application's functionality. Perform thorough regression testing to ensure that removing privileges does not break any existing functionality.
Adjust Threshold:

You may also want to consider adjusting the threshold value in the script based on your application's size and complexity. The threshold is currently set to 25, but you can adjust it to a value that makes sense for your specific situation.
Documentation:

Document the changes made to the cross-scope privileges and the reasons behind those changes. This documentation will be helpful for future reference and for other team members who might work on the application.
Communication:

If your application is part of a larger system or used by other teams, communicate the changes made to the cross-scope privileges to ensure everyone is aware of the modifications.
Remember that modifying cross-scope privileges can have significant implications, so it's crucial to approach this process with caution and conduct thorough testing to avoid any negative impact on the application.
