//Step one : Presented the result Script from ServiceNow after the run of Instance Scan

//User 
//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
//"Description"
When there is no ACL for an UI Page, by default the UI Page can be accessed by all the logged-in internal users. If there is no, script level authorization checks like gs.hasRole('user_admin'), then any logged in user can access this UI Page and change anybody's password by passing the user sys_id and the new password.

//"Resolution Details"
UI Pages making call to server side code should have ACL's implemented.

//"Script"
(function (finding, current) {
	
    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','ui_page');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}

})(finding, current);

//Answer
To address the ServiceNow request for creating an Access Control List (ACL) for a Client Callable Script Include (CCSI), you can use JavaScript to create the ACL. Below is a JavaScript script that you can use in your ServiceNow instance to define the required roles for accessing a Client Callable Script Include. Please note that this script should be run in a ServiceNow environment with administrative privileges:

javascript
Copy code
// Define the name of the Client Callable Script Include
var scriptIncludeName = 'YourClientCallableScriptIncludeName';

// Define the required roles for accessing the Client Callable Script Include
var requiredRoles = ['snc_internal']; // You can add more roles as needed

// Create an ACL record for the Client Callable Script Include
var acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
acl.initialize();
acl.setValue('name', 'ACL for ' + scriptIncludeName);
acl.setValue('operation', 'execute');
acl.setValue('script_include', scriptIncludeName);
acl.setValue('script', 'current');
acl.insert();

// Attach the required roles to the ACL record
for (var i = 0; i < requiredRoles.length; i++) {
    var role = requiredRoles[i];
    var aclRole = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl_role');
    aclRole.initialize();
    aclRole.setValue('acl', acl.sys_id);
    aclRole.setValue('role', role);
    aclRole.insert();
}

gs.print('ACL created and roles attached for ' + scriptIncludeName);
Please make sure to replace 'YourClientCallableScriptIncludeName' with the actual name of your Client Callable Script Include, and adjust the requiredRoles array to include the roles that should have access to it.

After running this script, an ACL will be created for your Client Callable Script Include, and the specified roles will be granted access to it. This helps secure your Client Callable Script Include by restricting access to authorized users only.
