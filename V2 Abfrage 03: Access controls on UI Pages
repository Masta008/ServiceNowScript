//Step one : Presented the result Script from ServiceNow after the run of Instance Scan

//User 
//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
//"Description"
When there is no ACL for an UI Page, by default the UI Page can be accessed by all the logged-in internal users. If there is no, script level authorization checks like gs.hasRole('user_admin'), then any logged in user can access this UI Page and change anybody's password by passing the user sys_id and the new password.

//"Resolution Details"
UI Pages making call to server side code should have ACL's implemented.

//Answer
To address the ServiceNow request, you need to ensure that UI Pages have ACLs implemented to control access. You can create an ACL (Access Control List) for your UI Page to restrict access based on specific conditions. In your case, you want to restrict access to users who have specific roles or permissions. Below is a JavaScript script that you can use to create an ACL for a UI Page in ServiceNow:

javascript
Copy code
// Set the name of your UI Page and the roles that should have access
var uiPageName = 'your_ui_page_name';
var allowedRoles = ['user_admin', 'other_required_roles'];

// Check if the ACL already exists
var acl = new GlideAccessControlList();
if (acl.get('name', uiPageName)) {
    gs.info('ACL for UI Page ' + uiPageName + ' already exists. No changes made.');
} else {
    // Create a new ACL
    acl.initialize();
    acl.setValue('name', uiPageName);
    acl.setValue('description', 'Access control for ' + uiPageName + ' UI Page');
    
    // Set the script that enforces access control
    var script = "if (gs.hasRole('" + allowedRoles.join("') || gs.hasRole('") + "')) {gs.log('Access granted for UI Page: " + uiPageName + "');answer = true;} else {gs.log('Access denied for UI Page: " + uiPageName + "');answer = false;}";
    acl.setValue('script', script);
    
    // Save the ACL
    acl.insert();
    
    gs.info('ACL for UI Page ' + uiPageName + ' created successfully.');
}
Replace 'your_ui_page_name' with the name of your UI Page and 'user_admin', 'other_required_roles' with the roles that should have access to the UI Page. The script checks if an ACL with the specified name already exists, and if not, it creates a new ACL that enforces access control based on the provided roles.

Make sure to execute this script in a server-side script context within ServiceNow to create or update the ACL for your UI Page. After running the script, the UI Page will be protected, and only users with the specified roles will have access to it.
