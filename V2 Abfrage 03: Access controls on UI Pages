//Step one : Presented the result Script from ServiceNow after the run of Instance Scan

//User 
//please program a javascript script solution for the following servicenow request:
//"Description"
When there is no ACL for an UI Page, by default the UI Page can be accessed by all the logged-in internal users. If there is no, script level authorization checks like gs.hasRole('user_admin'), then any logged in user can access this UI Page and change anybody's password by passing the user sys_id and the new password.

//"Resolution Details"
UI Pages making call to server side code should have ACL's implemented.

//"Script"
(function (finding, current) {
	
    var gr_acl = new GlideRecord('sys_security_acl');
		gr_acl.addQuery('type','ui_page');
		gr_acl.addQuery('name','CONTAINS',current.name);
		gr_acl.query();
		if(!gr_acl.next()){
			finding.setCurrentSource(current);
			finding.increment();
		}

})(finding, current);

//Answer
To address the ServiceNow request, you can create a server-side script that enforces ACL-like access control for UI Pages. In ServiceNow, you can implement such logic using Script Includes. Here's a JavaScript script solution that enforces access control for UI Pages in ServiceNow:

Create a new Script Include in ServiceNow by navigating to "System Definition" -> "Script Includes."

Create a new Script Include, for example, named "CustomUIAccessControl."

In the "CustomUIAccessControl" Script Include, you can add the following code:

javascript
Copy code
var CustomUIAccessControl = Class.create();
CustomUIAccessControl.prototype = {
  initialize: function() {},

  // Function to check access control for a UI Page
  checkAccess: function(userSysId, pageName) {
    // Check if the user has a specific role (e.g., 'user_admin') or other authorization checks.
    if (!gs.hasRole('user_admin')) {
      // Deny access to the UI Page
      gs.log("Access denied for user: " + userSysId + " to UI Page: " + pageName);
      return false;
    }
    
    // Implement additional ACL-like checks or conditions as needed.

    // Allow access if no restrictions are met
    return true;
  },

  type: 'CustomUIAccessControl'
};
Save the Script Include.

Now, for each UI Page in ServiceNow, you should define a script that checks access using the CustomUIAccessControl Script Include. Here's an example of how you can implement this within your UI Page server script:

javascript
Copy code
// Include the CustomUIAccessControl script include
var uiAccessControl = new CustomUIAccessControl();

// Get the user's sys_id (you may need to adjust how you get this)
var userSysId = gs.getUser().getID();
var pageName = 'your_ui_page_name'; // Replace with the name of your UI Page

// Check access control
if (uiAccessControl.checkAccess(userSysId, pageName)) {
  // Implement the logic for your UI Page here.
  // If access is granted, the user has the necessary roles or permissions.
  // You can proceed with your UI Page logic here.
} else {
  // Access is denied. You can return an error message or redirect the user.
  // For example:
  // gs.addErrorMessage("Access denied for this UI Page.");
  // action.setRedirectURL('your_redirect_url');
}
Save your UI Page script.
By implementing this solution, you ensure that UI Pages making calls to server-side code check for proper access control. You can customize the access control checks within the CustomUIAccessControl Script Include and perform additional checks as needed for your specific use case.
