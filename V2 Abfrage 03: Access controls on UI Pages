/ServiceNow Field: "Description"
When there is no ACL for an UI Page, by default the UI Page can be accessed by all the logged-in internal users. If there is no, script level authorization checks like gs.hasRole('user_admin'), then any logged in user can access this UI Page and change anybody's password by passing the user sys_id and the new password.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
UI Pages making call to server side code should have ACL's implemented.
