//ServiceNow Field: "Description"
Having many Cross Privileges in a custom application, might be an indication that during development these Cross Scope privileges were added unintentionally.

//ServiceNow Field: "Resolution Details"
Recommendation is to investigate each Cross Scope privilege and identify whether this is really needed as part of the application. If not remove the privilege.
Removing privileges might require regression testing to ensure that nothing will break. The extend of testing will depend on the Application size.

//ServiceNow Field "Script"
(function(finding, current) {

    var threshold = 25; // number of cross scope 
    // get number of cross scope privileges
    var snGr = new GlideAggregate('sys_scope_privilege');
    snGr.addQuery('sys_scope', current.sys_id.toString());
    snGr.addAggregate('COUNT');
    snGr.query(); // get all
    if (snGr.next()) {
        // compare against threshold
        var count = snGr.getAggregate('COUNT');
        if (count > threshold) {
            // add finding

            finding.setCurrentSource(current);
            finding.increment();
        }
    }


})(finding, current);

//Answer ChatGPT
The code you've provided appears to be a script that checks for the presence of cross-scope privileges in a custom application and generates a "finding" if the number of cross-scope privileges exceeds a certain threshold. This script seems to be part of a larger application security or audit process.

Here's a breakdown of the code and some recommendations:

    Threshold Setting: You have defined a threshold variable (threshold) to determine when to trigger a finding. In your code, the threshold is set to 25.

    Querying Cross-Scope Privileges: The script uses GlideAggregate to query the 'sys_scope_privilege' table for cross-scope privileges associated with the current application (current.sys_id). It aggregates the count of such privileges.

    Comparison with Threshold: It compares the count of cross-scope privileges against the threshold. If the count exceeds the threshold, it sets a "finding."

    Finding Handling: The script seems to use some custom object or structure called "finding" to keep track of these findings. It associates the finding with the current item being checked.

Here are some recommendations and additional considerations:

    Documentation: Make sure to document this script properly, explaining its purpose, usage, and how the "finding" is handled and reported.

    Testing: As you mentioned, removing privileges might require regression testing. Depending on the application's size and complexity, the testing effort can vary. It's essential to thoroughly test the application after making changes to ensure that nothing breaks.

    Review and Decision-Making: Before removing any privileges, it's crucial to review each cross-scope privilege carefully. Understand why it was added in the first place and whether it's still necessary for the application's functionality or security. Involve stakeholders in this decision-making process.

    Logging and Reporting: Consider adding logging or reporting mechanisms to track which cross-scope privileges were found to exceed the threshold and which ones were removed. This can help in audit trails and accountability.

    Error Handling: Add error-handling mechanisms to gracefully handle any exceptions that may occur during the script's execution.

    Scheduled Execution: Depending on your use case, you might want to schedule this script to run periodically to continuously monitor the application's privilege usage.

    Consider Impact: Understand the potential impact of removing privileges. Some privileges might be critical for the application's operation. Ensure that you have a rollback plan in case something unexpected happens.

    Code Review: Have the code reviewed by a team member to ensure its correctness and effectiveness.

In summary, the code you've provided appears to be a useful tool for identifying potential security or design issues in your custom application. However, it's essential to proceed with caution and involve stakeholders in the decision-making process when removing privileges to avoid unintended consequences.

Write me a solution script


//Answer ChatGPT
To create a solution script for managing cross-scope privileges in a custom application, you can use JavaScript in a scripting environment like ServiceNow. Below is a sample script that provides a framework for identifying and managing these privileges. Please note that this is a template, and you should adapt it to your specific needs and environment.

javascript

(function() {
    // Configuration
    var threshold = 25; // Set the threshold for identifying excessive cross-scope privileges
    var currentAppSysId = gs.getProperty('glide.app.id'); // Get the current application's sys_id

    // Query cross-scope privileges for the current application
    var privilegeGr = new GlideRecord('sys_scope_privilege');
    privilegeGr.addQuery('sys_scope', currentAppSysId);
    privilegeGr.query();

    var findings = []; // Array to store findings

    // Loop through cross-scope privileges
    while (privilegeGr.next()) {
        // Check if privilege is associated with a different scope
        if (privilegeGr.scope != currentAppSysId) {
            findings.push({
                'name': privilegeGr.name,
                'scope': privilegeGr.scope.getDisplayValue()
            });
        }
    }

    // If there are more cross-scope privileges than the threshold, generate findings
    if (findings.length > threshold) {
        for (var i = 0; i < findings.length; i++) {
            var finding = findings[i];
            gs.info('Cross-scope privilege "' + finding.name + '" in scope "' + finding.scope + '"');
            
            // Optionally, you can remove or modify privileges here
            // Example: privilegeGr.deleteRecord(); // Remove the privilege
        }
        
        gs.warn('There are ' + findings.length + ' cross-scope privileges in the application. Review and take action as needed.');
    } else {
        gs.info('No excessive cross-scope privileges found in the application.');
    }
})();

In this script:

    We define a threshold variable to specify the maximum allowable number of cross-scope privileges.

    We use GlideRecord to query the 'sys_scope_privilege' table to retrieve privileges associated with the current application (currentAppSysId).

    We loop through the results and identify privileges that have a different scope than the current application.

    If the number of excessive cross-scope privileges exceeds the threshold, it generates findings (warnings) in the system log. You can optionally remove or modify these privileges within the loop.

    If there are no excessive privileges, it logs that no issues were found.

Please ensure that you adapt this script to your specific environment, including configuring the currentAppSysId variable appropriately and implementing any necessary error handling or reporting mechanisms. Additionally, thoroughly test the script in a non-production environment before deploying it in a production environment.
